# Project Lattice: Complex-Valued Social Governance Engine

> **"From Amorphous Conflict to Crystalline Harmony."** > Project Lattice is an open-source, decentralised governance framework that maps social policies and consensus onto a complex vector space to achieve autonomous equilibrium.

---

## 🌌 The Core Philosophy

Traditional voting systems are 1-dimensional (Yes/No). They ignore the "tension" and "balance" required for a sustainable society. Project Lattice redefines social states as **complex vectors** within a 4-axis tetrahedron model.

By leveraging **Complex-Valued Logic**, we allow for:

* **Real axis ():** Tangible impacts (Economic Growth vs. Social Justice).
* **Imaginary axis ():** Intangible values (Technological Disruption vs. Cultural Preservation).

We believe that governance is not about winning a majority; it is about **minimizing the distortion of the social crystal.**

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

The engine is built on three main layers:

### 1. Lattice-CLI (The Analyzer)

An NLP-driven engine that parses policy documents into 4-axis vectors.

* **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers (LLM-based vectorization).
* **Input:** Natural language policy proposals.
* **Output:** 

### 2. TetraCore.sol (The On-chain Governor)

A set of smart contracts that manage the "Social Gravity."

* **Equilibrium Calculation:** Calculates the  norm of the global vector sum to measure "Social Distortion" ().
* **Dynamic Minting:** Adjusts token rewards based on . High distortion = Low rewards (Incentive for rebalancing).

### 3. Reputation.sol (Proof of Balance)

A non-transferable Soulbound Token (SBT) system that weights voting power based on a user's historical contribution to social stability.

---

## 🧮 Mathematical Model

The stability of the city is defined by the Distortion Function :

When a new proposal  is submitted, the system calculates the potential distortion :

If , the contract triggers an **"Offset Obligation,"** requiring the proposer to either stake more tokens or include a counter-balancing sub-project.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

We are looking for "Social Architects" in the following fields:

* **Algorithm Engineers:** Refine the `TetraCore` gas efficiency and square root approximations.
* **Data Scientists:** Map real-world city statistics (IoT, GIS) into the 4-axis vector model.
* **Smart Contract Developers:** Implement Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for private but verifiable voting.
* **UI/UX Designers:** Visualise 4D social tensors into intuitive 3D mobile interfaces.

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shiojiri-city/project-lattice.git
cd project-lattice
npm install
npx hardhat test

```
